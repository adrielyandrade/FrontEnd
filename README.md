# FrontEnd Study Repository

This repository is dedicated to storing my exercises and study projects focused on frontend development technologies such as **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vite, Tailwind, and Others**. These projects reflect what I have learned through classroom lessons, practical exercises, and online courses, helping me strengthen my skills in building websites and interactive applications.
